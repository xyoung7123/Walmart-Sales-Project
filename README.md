## Recommendation & Conclusion
In conclusion, it can be seen that economic indices such as inflation rate, unemployment rate and seasons have a massive impact in the sales figures in one of the biggest retail business in the United state. To avoid running out of stock, it is necessary to increase the stock level around summer & the 4 major holiday period. Also due to increase in customer price index and hence inflation, there is need by the government and organizations to increase workers income to meet up with increased standard of living inorder to balance the reducing purchasing power.
